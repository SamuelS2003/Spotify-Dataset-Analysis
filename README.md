# README: Spotify Dataset Analysis Using Python

**Overview** 

This project analyzes a Spotify dataset to uncover insights about artist popularity, album popularity, and explicit content distribution. The analysis includes a detailed data cleaning process and various visualizations to highlight key trends and patterns in the dataset.

**Objectives**
1. Clean and preprocess the Spotify dataset for analysis.
2. Visualize the following key metrics:
    Artist Popularity: Highlight top artists and their performance.
    Album Popularity: Show the distribution and standout albums.
    Explicit Content Distribution: Represented through a pie chart.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information about Spotify tracks, including attributes like artist names, album names, track popularity, and explicit content flags.

**Tools and Libraries**

Python Libraries Used:
1. pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
2. matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
   
***Data Cleaning Process***

Handling Missing Values:

Identified and handled null or missing entries in key columns such as artist_name, album_name, and track_popularity.
Used mean or median imputation for numeric columns and mode for categorical columns.

Data Type Conversion:

Ensured appropriate data types for numeric and categorical columns.

Removing Duplicates:

Eliminated duplicate rows to avoid redundancy in the analysis.

Standardizing Text:

Standardized text fields for consistency, e.g., lowercasing and removing extra spaces in artist_name and album_name.

***Data Visualizations***

Artist Popularity:

A bar chart displaying the top 10 most popular artists based on track popularity.

Album Popularity:

A bar chart showing the distribution of album popularity scores.

Explicit Content Distribution:

A pie chart representing the proportion of explicit vs. non-explicit tracks in the dataset.

***Running the Code***

Clone the repository.

git clone <repository-url>
cd spotify-dataset-analysis

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Run the analysis script:

python spotify analysis.py

**Results**

The analysis provides insights into the trends of artist and album popularity and highlights the explicit content distribution across tracks.

**Future Work**

Explore correlations between track popularity and audio features like tempo or danceability.
Perform sentiment analysis on song lyrics if available
